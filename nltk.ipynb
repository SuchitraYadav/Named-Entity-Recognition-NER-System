An example would include the ability of the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency[153] and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus.[154] These latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.[155]', 'entities': [(456, 466, 'MEDICALCONDITION'), (471, 479, 'MEDICALCONDITION'), (419, 441, 'PATHOGEN'), (365, 383, 'PATHOGEN'), (707, 722, 'PATHOGEN'), (181, 201, 'PATHOGEN'), (456, 467, 'MEDICALCONDITION')]}, {'content': 'Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores.
